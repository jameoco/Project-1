Downloading log data from Kibana on web server<br>

It received a 200-status code so I donâ€™t believe it was malicious I think it was a simple request to get information from Kibana on web server data analytics<br>

At first glance it looks like everything is ok and nothing to dig more into.<br>
Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidelines?<br>
The fact that a large zip file was downloaded and can be run through Linux could potentially have some compliance issues as we would not want anyone downloading anything typically other then admins. <br>
